​


| ​",1.000,medium,incorrect,0.92,"The raw mention is the single word “Target,” appearing in a snippet that looks like a table heading (“Our framework for securing new capacity | … |”). In this context, “target” is far more likely to be a generic term meaning objective/goal/desired level (e.g., target capacity, target price, target date) or a column label in a framework table, not a reference to Target Corporation (the retail chain). There is no accompanying identifier such as “Target Corporation,” “Target Corp.,” “TGT,” or retail-related context (stores, merchandise, guest, etc.) that would anchor the mention to the public company. Additionally, the asserted relationship type (HAS_PARTNER) is unsupported by the snippet; nothing indicates a commercial partnership. From a business-logic standpoint, Hut 8 (energy infrastructure / bitcoin mining / HPC) having a partner relationship specifically with Target Corp. is implausible without strong contextual evidence.",A partner relationship between Hut 8’s energy/digital infrastructure business and Target Corp.’s mass retail operations would be unusual and would typically be explicitly described; the provided context does not support it.,"“Target” is being used as a common noun (a goal/benchmark) or a table column header (e.g., target capacity, target timeline), not as a company name."

The raw mention “Madison Square Garden Sports” is a direct shortened form of the legal name Madison Square Garden Sports Corp. (ticker MSGS). There is little to no ambiguity because the mention includes the distinctive full brand name and the context even specifies the corporate suffix.,MSGE (entertainment venues/promotions) and MSGS (sports teams/related assets) are closely related MSG entities and it is plausible that MSGS would provide sponsorship sales representation services for MSGE assets via an agreement.

The surrounding text explicitly includes “Inc.” and frames it as a TPG-sponsored real estate product/vehicle, which aligns with TRTX being externally managed by an affiliate of TPG and commonly referenced by this name.

In this context, “Comstock” is far more likely to be the name of a generating facility/project or a geographic/location reference (e.g., a plant or project named Comstock) within CMS’s independent power portfolio, not a reference to Comstock Inc. (formerly Comstock Mining), a Nevada-based precious metals mining company.

Name-match quality is weak: “Comstock” is a common proper noun used for places and projects and is not uniquely identifying of the public company LODE. The filing context does not mention mining, Nevada, gold/silver, “Comstock Mining,” “Comstock Inc.,” or any corporate identifiers.

Business logic also conflicts with the asserted relationship type HAS_CUSTOMER: a list of independent power plants CMS owns is about assets/investments, not customers. Even if a c","Unlikely.

The context clarifies that the competitor is Vectron International, identified as a division of Knowles Corporation; Vectron is known in frequency control products that plausibly compete with LGL’s timing/frequency components. There is little risk of confusion with another similarly named entity because the mention includes the corporate form and is used as a parent company identifier.","LGL makes frequency/timing electronic components; Vectron (a Knowles division) operates in frequency control, making a competitor relationship plausible.

This clearly identifies the public company Celestica Inc. (NYSE/TSX: CLS) and matches its business description (design/manufacturing and supply chain solutions). However, the asserted relationship type HAS_SUPPLIER is not supported by the context; Celestica is referenced as an outside directorship of an individual, not as a supplier to Cohu. Therefore the specific entity-relationship match (Cohu has supplier Celestica) is incorrect even though the underlying entity identification is likely right.","A supplier relationship between Cohu (semiconductor test handlers/equipment) and Celestica (electronics manufacturing services) is not established in the provided text; the mention is about governance/board roles, not procurement or supply.","The mention most likely refers to Celestica Inc. as a company where the named individual serves as a director (an ‘other directorship’/affiliation), not a supplier relationship.

The context is a competitor list of “private and public HSC companies,” which fits Beam’s business as a gene-editing/base-editing biotechnology company with hematology programs that could compete in HSC-related therapies. There are no obvious alternative well-known entities with this exact name, and the inclusion of “Inc.” further indicates a specific corporate entity rather than a generic term.","Vor Bio operates in cell and genome engineering for hematologic malignancies and HSC-based approaches; Beam Therapeutics is a gene-editing biotech developing precision genetic medicines, including hematology/HSC-related applications.

There are no contextual cues suggesting a different ‘Caterpillar’ entity (e.g., a local firm or unrelated ‘Caterpillar’ product). In SEC filings, “Caterpillar” in an industrial/power-competitor context overwhelmingly refers to Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries (Cat Power Systems).","Plausible and consistent: Polar Power operates in power systems for telecom and other applications; Caterpillar is a major competitor in generator/power equipment markets, commonly cited alongside Generac/Cummins/Kohler.

In this context, ""Apple"" most plausibly refers to Apple Inc. as operator of major digital music retail/streaming channels (iTunes Store, Apple Music), which are commonly cited alongside Amazon as online music retailers. While the music industry also contains entities like Apple Corps/Apple Records, those would not typically be referenced as an online retailer/distribution outlet in the same breath as amazon.com.

(PCC), a major producer of titanium and superalloy components/forgings. It is common in SEC filings to cite the parent company name rather than the operating subsidiary when describing competitors. Therefore the entity resolution to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

However, the provided surrounding context is a generic discussion of changes in the competitive landscape and technology, and does not show any explicit partner relationship, nor does it show that “Global Payments” appears in a competitor list or a contractual/relationship description. Additionally, “global payments” can be used as a generic phrase meaning worldwide payment activity; capitalization alone is not sufficient to disambiguate without more nearby text (e.g., listing other company names, ‘Inc.,’ or discussion of a specific agreement). Given the limited context and a questionable relationship type (HAS_PARTNER vs likely competitor/general industry reference), the match cannot be confirmed with high confidence.","Shift4 and Global Payments are in the same industry; mentioning Global Payments as a competitor would be logical, but describing it as a ‘partner’ is not supported by the provided context and is less likely.",The phrase could be a generic reference to global/international payments rather than the specific company Global Payments Inc.; or it could be referencing Global Payments as a competitor rather than a partner.

There is little risk of confusion with another entity because the mention is grouped with other major consumer social networks and is not used as a generic noun or acronym. Thus the entity match to PINTEREST, INC. (PINS) is appropriate.

One nuance: the surrounding sentence indicates Lulus uses these platforms for marketing/distribution, which is more a “platform/channel used” than a formal strategic partnership. However, that affects relationship typing more than entity resolution—the referenced entity is still Pinterest, Inc.’s service.","Plausible: an online women’s fashion retailer would market via social platforms including Pinterest, which is heavily used for fashion and lifestyle inspiration.

Note: while the entity match is correct, the stated relationship type (HAS_SUPPLIER) is somewhat strained—Apple is better characterized as a platform/distribution partner/gatekeeper (app store operator) rather than a traditional supplier—but this does not undermine the correctness of the company identity match.","IAC’s digital businesses plausibly depend on Apple’s iOS ecosystem/App Store for marketing/distribution/monetization, consistent with the disclosure about reliance on major platform operators.",Unlikely; other companies with ‘Apple’ in the name would not be described as operating a digital app store/social media platform. The only reasonable interpretation here is Apple Inc.

However, the asserted relationship type HAS_CUSTOMER is not supported by the context. PNC states it provides card transaction processing services to *merchant customers* under agreements it has with payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard. In this construction, Visa and Mastercard are counterparties/network partners that provide the payment network rails and rules under which PNC processes transactions for merchants; they are not described as PNC’s customers. If anything, PNC is a participant/customer of the network, or Mastercard is a network partner/supplier, not a customer.",Banks commonly have agreements with payment networks (Visa/Mastercard) to enable card issuance/acquiring and transaction processing. The merchants are the customers; the networks are partners/platforms. Mastercard being a “customer” of PNC’s processing services is not the typical commercial structure and is not implied here.,"“Mastercard” refers to the Mastercard payment network/brand (Mastercard Inc. and its network) as an agreement counterparty, not as a customer. The correct relation would be something like HAS_PARTNER / USES_NETWORK / HAS_SUPPLIER rather than HAS_CUSTOMER."

While ""Apple"" most commonly refers to Apple Inc. in SEC filings, the context could just as plausibly be referencing Apple devices/platforms (e.g., iPhone/iOS) used by employees or as an example of a third-party technology ecosystem, not a Healthcare Triangle customer. Given the lack of corroborating context and the questionable ""HAS_CUSTOMER"" relationship, the match cannot be confirmed with high confidence.","Healthcare Triangle is a healthcare IT/cloud/data services provider; Apple Inc. is a consumer electronics/services company. It is not impossible for Apple to be a customer (e.g., contracting for services), but it is not a typical/obvious customer relationship for this type of issuer. The snippet looks like a data security disclosure, not a customer discussion, which further weakens the business-logic fit for a customer link.","The mention may refer to Apple as a third-party technology platform/device ecosystem (iOS/iPhone/iPad/Mac) involved in data handling, or could be part of a generic example list of major tech providers, rather than identifying Apple Inc. as a customer of Healthcare Triangle."

There is no abbreviation or generic term here, and it is unlikely to refer to another entity given the exact corporate name.

Context supports this interpretation: the passage lists “Southern Power’s top three customers … Georgia Power, Florida Power & Light Company, and Duke Energy Corporation … of Southern Power’s total revenues.” Duke Energy is a large regulated U.S. electric utility and an active wholesale/bilateral power market participant, so it is plausible for it to be a significant customer of Southern Power (a generation/marketing affiliate of Southern Company).

One nuance: the customer relationship described is between Southern Power and Duke Energy, not necessarily directly between Georgia Power (the filing entity) and Duke Energy. But that affects relationship attribution, not the identity of the referenced entity.",Plausible: both are major U.S. electric utilities/energy companies; Duke Energy can purchase power under wholesale PPAs or market transactions. Being a top customer of Southern Power is credible.,"Unlikely; the exact corporate name strongly indicates Duke Energy Corp (DUK), not another similarly named entity."

In the provided context, MaxLinear lists “primary merchant semiconductor competitors,” alongside other clearly identified semiconductor peers (Silicon Labs, NXP, MediaTek, Broadcom, etc.). This context strongly indicates the mention refers to Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN), not a generic term or unrelated entity. No ambiguity or alternative Texas Instruments entity is suggested in the text.","MaxLinear and Texas Instruments both operate in the semiconductor industry (analog/mixed-signal, connectivity, RF and related components), so a competitor relationship is plausible and consistent with typical competitive landscapes described in 10-K filings.","Unlikely; absent any qualifier suggesting a subsidiary, product line, or different organization, “Texas Instruments” in a semiconductor competitor list almost certainly refers to Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN)."

However, the provided surrounding context is a generic section about Performance Materials & Coatings net sales and products and does not show Celanese being discussed at all, much less as a supplier. In Dow’s 10‑K, Celanese could plausibly appear as a competitor, peer, customer, or in an industry list rather than a supplier. Without the actual sentence where “Celanese” appears, there is insufficient evidence to confirm both that the mention indeed refers to CE and that the asserted HAS_SUPPLIER relationship is correct.","Dow and Celanese are both chemical manufacturers; a supplier relationship is possible (e.g., specialty chemicals/inputs), but it is not the most typical or obvious relationship and would require clear textual support. The provided context does not support a supplier relationship.","The mention could be part of a list of competitors/peers in a product market, an industry benchmark/market share discussion, or a customer/partner reference rather than a supplier.

The surrounding text points to a cross-reference to Enact’s risk factors (“Enact Holdings’ reliance on key customers…”), consistent with an affiliate/subsidiary discussion, not a third‑party vendor relationship.

Thus, while the named entity aligns with the target company, the asserted relationship type (HAS_SUPPLIER: source mentions target as a supplier) is inconsistent with the business reality and context; Enact is not a supplier to Genworth but rather a controlled/related entity whose risks Genworth discusses.",Genworth Financial is the parent/controlling shareholder of Enact Holdings and discusses Enact as part of its business and risk factors. It would not typically classify its own subsidiary as a supplier. A supplier relationship here is implausible.,"The mention is best interpreted as referencing Genworth’s subsidiary/affiliate Enact Holdings (i.e., a segment, equity method investment, or controlled subsidiary), not a supplier. If the resolution system needed a relationship, it should be SUBSIDIARY/AFFILIATE/OWNS rather than HAS_SUPPLIER."

Wayfair, Inc., which concerns state sales tax nexus for out-of-state/online sellers. In this passage, Cricut is not identifying Wayfair as a market competitor; it is citing a court case that removed a barrier to states taxing remote sellers. Therefore, the HAS_COMPETITOR relationship is not supported by the context, and the competitor match is erroneous even though the case name is derived from Wayfair Inc.","Cricut (DIY crafting machines/materials) and Wayfair (home furnishings e-commerce) are not direct competitors; citing the 'Wayfair decision' is a common sales-tax nexus reference, not competitive positioning.","Refers to the Supreme Court decision 'South Dakota v.

In the marketing automation/customer engagement software space, Braze, Inc. is a well-known vendor frequently positioned as a competitor/alternative for customer engagement and messaging, which aligns with Klaviyo’s market. No contextual cues suggest a different entity (e.g., non-software usage of the word ""braze""), and the peer grouping with Mailchimp, Adobe, and Salesforce strongly indicates the software company.","Klaviyo provides marketing automation/email/SMS and customer data-driven personalization; Braze provides a customer engagement platform (messaging/personalization). These are overlapping, competitive categories, so identifying Braze as a competitor is plausible and common in the industry.","Could theoretically be the generic verb/noun ""braze"" (metal-joining) or a small private company named Braze, but the marketing software competitor list context makes these interpretations very unlikely."

In this 10-K context, “Microsoft” clearly refers to the global software/cloud provider Microsoft Corporation, not a generic term or a different entity. Accenture is widely known to have strategic partnerships with Microsoft (Azure, Dynamics, M365) consistent with the stated relationship type (HAS_PARTNER). No contextual cues suggest a different Microsoft-branded entity or product-only reference.","Accenture (IT services/consulting) commonly partners with large platform vendors; Microsoft is a primary partner ecosystem for cloud, enterprise software and digital transformation services. Listing Microsoft alongside AWS and Adobe strongly supports a technology-partner relationship.","Unlikely; could theoretically refer to Microsoft-branded products/services, but in a partner list of technology providers it effectively denotes Microsoft Corporation."

(PFE), the well-known global biopharmaceutical parent. There is no indication of a different Pfizer entity (e.g., a private company with the same name) and the healthcare/pharma context aligns strongly with Pfizer Inc.","It is plausible for AN2 Therapeutics to reference Pfizer as the parent company of a licensor (Anacor) in connection with a license agreement for epetraborole. While the relationship type may be more accurately described as licensor/counterparty via Anacor rather than a direct “supplier,” the entity identified by the mention (Pfizer Inc.) is consistent with the context.","If the relationship were being mapped strictly to the contracting party, the mention could be intended to point to Anacor Pharmaceuticals (the subsidiary) rather than Pfizer Inc.

There are no contextual clues suggesting a different 'Century' entity (e.g., media/entertainment or 'Century' as a generic term); it appears as a proper noun in a competitor list alongside other specific biotech companies. Therefore, the competitor relationship and entity resolution are well supported.","Plausible and consistent: both companies operate in the allogeneic cell therapy / engineered immune cell space (including NK-cell related approaches), making Century Therapeutics a reasonable competitor to NKGen.","Unlikely.

The surrounding context lists other well-known paperboard/paper packaging competitors (WestRock, Graphic Packaging, Metsä Group, Sappi), indicating the discussion is about paperboard producers. Clearwater Paper is a recognized manufacturer/supplier of paperboard and tissue products, making it a plausible competitor in this segment. There are no contextual cues suggesting a different entity with the same name, and the term is not a generic word or ambiguous abbreviation.","RYAM participates in cellulose/paper-related markets and can face competition in paperboard; Clearwater Paper is an established paper/paperboard producer, so identifying it as a competitor is commercially consistent.","Unlikely; could theoretically refer to a private regional company named Clearwater Paper, but given the peer list of major industry players, the public company CLW is the most consistent interpretation."

In EU drug regulation, “MA” commonly stands for “Marketing Authorization” (or “Marketing Authorisation”), referring to approval to market a medicinal product in a country/region. This is consistent with Scilex’s business (drug development) and the described decentralized procedure in the EEA.

There is no indication the text is referring to Mastercard Inc. The mention is not a company name usage (no “Mastercard,” “MasterCard,” payments context, partners, etc.), and it is clearly not a competitor reference. Matching “MA” to ticker MA is a classic false positive where a generic abbreviation is mapped to a public-company ticker.","Scilex (biopharma/pain management) discussing EU regulatory filing procedures would not be referring to Mastercard as a competitor; the industries are unrelated and the surrounding text is about drug approval, not payments.","“MA” = Marketing Authorization/Marketing Authorisation (regulatory approval) in the EEA decentralized procedure, not Mastercard Inc."

Context supports the interpretation: the mention appears in a competitive landscape sentence listing other cell therapy / immuno-oncology companies (e.g., Adicet Bio, Atara, BMS, Cabaletta). Autolus operates in CAR/T-cell therapies for cancer/autoimmune diseases, directly overlapping with Allogene’s allogeneic T-cell focus. Listing it as a competitor is business-logically consistent.

No obvious red flags (not a generic term, not a ticker-symbol collision, and the inclusion of “plc” further disambiguates).","Plausible and expected: both companies develop engineered T-cell therapies and compete for similar indications, partners, and clinical/commercial opportunities; competitor lists in 10-Ks commonly include Autolus alongside other T-cell therapy developers.",Unlikely.

This peer grouping strongly disambiguates the reference: it is almost certainly McKesson Corp (NYSE: MCK), not another smaller entity sharing the name. Therefore the entity match to MCKESSON CORP is correct.","Plausible and consistent: Tivic Health (health tech/medical device) entering distribution agreements with major healthcare distributors like McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen is a common go-to-market arrangement. Note: calling McKesson a ‘supplier’ may be directionally off (it is more like a distributor/channel partner/customer), but that does not affect the identity of the referenced entity.","Unlikely here given the explicit co-mention of Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen; absent that, ‘McKesson’ could theoretically refer to a non-public affiliate or a local entity with the McKesson name, but the context strongly points to McKesson Corporation."
