While the brand likely corresponds to The Western Union Company, the asserted relationship type (HAS_CUSTOMER: ATN → Western Union) is not supported—Western Union is not described as a customer of ATN, but rather a third-party payment/collection channel (agent/partner location).","It is plausible for a telecom operator’s customers to pay bills via Western Union agents/branches, but it would be a vendor/partner/payment processor relationship, not Western Union being ATN’s customer.",Could refer generically to Western Union agent locations/services used for bill payment (payment network/collection agent) rather than Western Union as a customer.

The context is a revenue concentration table listing major customers, consistent with Impinj’s business of selling RFID endpoint ICs/modules to RFID label/inlay manufacturers and solution providers; Avery Dennison (including its RFID/inlay businesses such as Smartrac) is a plausible large customer. No abbreviation ambiguity or generic term issues are present.","Impinj supplies RFID ICs used in tags/labels; Avery Dennison is a major RFID label/inlay manufacturer and would reasonably be a significant customer, making the HAS_CUSTOMER relationship sensible.","Could potentially reflect a specific Avery Dennison subsidiary or business unit (e.g., Smartrac) rather than the parent entity, but the mention names the parent corporation explicitly, so the resolved match remains appropriate."
