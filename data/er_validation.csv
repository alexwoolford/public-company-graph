The capitalization and possessive form (“RWT’s”) strongly signal a generic term/section label rather than a proper noun for the target company.","A HAS_CUSTOMER relationship would require context that RWT provides products/services to Strategy Inc.

No competing common meaning for “Zebra Technologies” appears in the snippet, and it is not a generic term or abbreviation.","ScanSource is a technology solutions distributor/reseller with hundreds of suppliers; Zebra sells barcode scanners, mobile computers, printers, RFID and related AIDC products that are distributed via channel partners.

The name match is exact and the transactional context aligns with Nasdaq, Inc.’s business and M&A history. There is no indication it refers to any other entity named Nasdaq.","Entity match makes sense: Nasdaq (NDAQ) was the buyer in the eSpeed acquisition.

However, the asserted relationship type HAS_CUSTOMER is not supported: Sportsman’s Warehouse is offering a co-branded credit card to its customers that runs on the Visa network and is issued by Comenity Bank. Visa would be a payments network/provider/partner, not a customer of Sportsman’s Warehouse. Thus the match as ‘target is a customer’ is incorrect.","A retailer may accept Visa or offer a Visa-branded card; that makes Visa a network/vendor/partner, not a customer. The business logic for HAS_CUSTOMER does not fit the context.","The mention is about the Visa card network/trademark used for the co-branded credit card (relationship more like USES_SERVICE / PARTNER), or could refer generically to a Visa-branded payment card rather than identifying Visa Inc. as a customer."

There are no contextual cues suggesting a different entity (e.g., a location or unrelated business).","SEI competes in investment processing, asset servicing/administration, and related technology solutions where State Street is a major competitor, alongside the other firms listed.

Therefore the specific resolved relationship type HAS_PARTNER is not supported by context, making this resolution case incorrect as labeled.","Arcus could in theory partner with large pharma, but the cited sentence is about other companies in the space, not a disclosed partner relationship.","This mention is more consistent with a COMPETITOR/INDUSTRY_PEER reference to Pfizer Inc., not a partner; if the relationship must be HAS_PARTNER, then the mention likely refers to a different portion of the filing (e.g., an actual collaboration) that is not shown here."

There is no common alternative meaning for this phrase in biotech/10‑K contexts, and the surrounding list names other biopharma companies (Novartis, Bio-Path, Syros, Faron, ALX Oncology), supporting that each item is a peer company. Therefore the mention is very likely referring to the public company Shattuck Labs, Inc.

In EU drug regulation, “MA” commonly stands for “Marketing Authorization” (or “Marketing Authorisation”), referring to approval to market a medicinal product in a country/region. This is consistent with Scilex’s business (drug development) and the described decentralized procedure in the EEA.

There is no indication the text is referring to Mastercard Inc. The mention is not a company name usage (no “Mastercard,” “MasterCard,” payments context, partners, etc.), and it is clearly not a competitor reference. Matching “MA” to ticker MA is a classic false positive where a generic abbreviation is mapped to a public-company ticker.","Scilex (biopharma/pain management) discussing EU regulatory filing procedures would not be referring to Mastercard as a competitor; the industries are unrelated and the surrounding text is about drug approval, not payments.","“MA” = Marketing Authorization/Marketing Authorisation (regulatory approval) in the EEA decentralized procedure, not Mastercard Inc."
