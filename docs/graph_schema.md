# Domain Status Graph Schema Documentation

## Overview

The Domain Status Graph is a focused knowledge graph that models domains and their technology stacks. The graph is designed to enable technology adoption prediction and affinity analysis using Graph Data Science (GDS).

**Purpose**: Enable technology adoption prediction and technology affinity bundling for competitive intelligence and sales targeting.

**Data Source**: SQLite database (`data/domain_status.db`) containing domain status checks and technology detection results. The database is generated by [`domain_status`](https://github.com/alexwoolford/domain_status), a Rust-based tool for high-performance concurrent URL checking and technology fingerprinting.

**Graph Database**: Neo4j (database: `domain`)

## Node Types

### Domain

**Label**: `Domain`

**Description**: Represents a web domain (e.g., `apple.com`, `microsoft.com`). This is the central entity in the graph.

**Unique Identifier**: `final_domain` (normalized domain name, lowercase, no `www.`)

**Properties**:

| Property | Type | Required | Description | Example Values |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `final_domain` | STRING | ✅ | Normalized domain name (unique key) | `apple.com`, `microsoft.com` |
| `domain` | STRING | ❌ | Original domain from source data | `www.apple.com`, `apple.com` |
| `status` | INTEGER | ❌ | HTTP status code | `200`, `307` |
| `status_description` | STRING | ❌ | Human-readable status description | `OK`, `Temporary Redirect` |
| `response_time` | FLOAT | ❌ | HTTP response time in seconds | `0.226` - `31.722` |
| `timestamp` | INTEGER | ❌ | Unix timestamp of status check | `1735689600` |
| `is_mobile_friendly` | INTEGER | ❌ | Mobile-friendly flag (0/1) | `0`, `1` |
| `spf_record` | STRING | ❌ | SPF (Sender Policy Framework) record | `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all` |
| `dmarc_record` | STRING | ❌ | DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication) record | `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine` |
| `creation_date` | INTEGER | ❌ | Domain registration date (Unix timestamp) | `1735689600` |
| `expiration_date` | INTEGER | ❌ | Domain expiration date (Unix timestamp) | `1767225600` |
| `registrar` | STRING | ❌ | Domain registrar name | `GoDaddy`, `Namecheap` |
| `registrant_country` | STRING | ❌ | Country of domain registrant | `US`, `GB` |
| `registrant_org` | STRING | ❌ | Organization name of registrant | `Apple Inc.` |
| `loaded_at` | DATETIME | ✅ | Timestamp when node was loaded into graph | `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` |

**Relationships**:
- `(Domain)-[:USES]->(Technology)` - Technologies used by the domain (from bootstrap)
- `(Domain)-[:LIKELY_TO_ADOPT {score}]->(Technology)` - Technology adoption predictions (from GDS)

**Use Cases**:
- Find all domains using a specific technology
- Compare technology stacks across companies
- Predict what technologies a domain is likely to adopt next
- Segment domains by technology sophistication

---

### Technology

**Label**: `Technology`

**Description**: Represents a technology, framework, library, or service detected on a domain (e.g., `WordPress`, `jQuery`, `Cloudflare`).

**Unique Identifier**: `name`

**Properties**:

| Property | Type | Required | Description | Example Values |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `name` | STRING | ✅ | Technology name (unique key) | `WordPress`, `jQuery`, `Cloudflare` |
| `category` | STRING | ❌ | Technology category | `CMS`, `JavaScript libraries`, `CDN` |
| `loaded_at` | DATETIME | ✅ | Timestamp when node was loaded | `2024-01-15T10:30:00Z` |

**Technology Categories** (examples):
- Analytics: Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics
- CMS: WordPress, Drupal
- JavaScript libraries: jQuery, React, Vue.js
- CDN: Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly
- And 60+ more categories

**Relationships**:
- `(Domain)-[:USES]->(Technology)` - Domains using this technology (from bootstrap)
- `(Technology)-[:CO_OCCURS_WITH {similarity}]->(Technology)` - Technology affinity pairs (from GDS)

**Use Cases**:
- Find all domains using a specific technology
- Find technologies that commonly co-occur (affinity bundling)
- Analyze technology adoption trends

## Relationship Types

### USES

**Type**: `(Domain)-[:USES]->(Technology)`

**Description**: Indicates that a domain uses a specific technology.

**Properties**:
- `loaded_at` (DATETIME) - When the relationship was created

**Example**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Domain {final_domain: 'apple.com'})-[:USES]->(t:Technology)
RETURN t.name, t.category
ORDER BY t.category, t.name
```

---

### LIKELY_TO_ADOPT

**Type**: `(Domain)-[:LIKELY_TO_ADOPT {score}]->(Technology)`

**Description**: GDS-computed prediction of technologies a domain is likely to adopt next, based on Personalized PageRank on the Technology-Technology co-occurrence graph.

**Properties**:
- `score` (FLOAT) - Adoption prediction score (higher = more likely)
- `computed_at` (DATETIME) - When the prediction was computed

**Example**:
```cypher
MATCH (d:Domain {final_domain: 'example.com'})-[r:LIKELY_TO_ADOPT]->(t:Technology)
RETURN t.name, r.score
ORDER BY r.score DESC
LIMIT 5
```

**Use Case**: Sales targeting, competitive intelligence, roadmap planning

---

### CO_OCCURS_WITH

**Type**: `(Technology)-[:CO_OCCURS_WITH {similarity}]->(Technology)`

**Description**: GDS-computed similarity between technologies based on Jaccard similarity of their co-occurrence patterns.

**Properties**:
- `similarity` (FLOAT) - Jaccard similarity score (0-1, higher = more similar)
- `metric` (STRING) - Similarity metric used (`JACCARD`)
- `computed_at` (DATETIME) - When the relationship was computed

**Example**:
```cypher
MATCH (t1:Technology {name: 'WordPress'})-[r:CO_OCCURS_WITH]->(t2:Technology)
RETURN t2.name, r.similarity
ORDER BY r.similarity DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Use Case**: Partnership opportunities, integration targeting, bundling strategies

- `metric` (STRING) - Similarity metric used (`COSINE`)
- `computed_at` (DATETIME) - When the relationship was computed

**Example**:
```cypher
MATCH (c1:Company {ticker: 'AAPL'})-[r:SIMILAR_DESCRIPTION]->(c2:Company)
RETURN c2.name, c2.ticker, r.score

## Data Loading

The graph is loaded from `data/domain_status.db` using `scripts/bootstrap_graph.py`:

1. **Domain nodes** - Loaded from `url_status` table
2. **Technology nodes** - Loaded from `url_technologies` table
3. **USES relationships** - Created from domain-technology mappings

GDS features are computed using `scripts/compute_gds_features.py`:

1. **LIKELY_TO_ADOPT relationships** - Computed using Personalized PageRank
2. **CO_OCCURS_WITH relationships** - Computed using Node Similarity (Jaccard)
3. **SIMILAR_DESCRIPTION relationships** - Computed using cosine similarity on embeddings
